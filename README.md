** Estimating Reinforcement Learning Parameters Using Genetic Algorithms **

---

# Aim 
This repo contains my source code for experimenting the use of *Genetic Algorithms* for estimating hyperparameters 
used in Reinforcement Learning . Open AI Gym is used as a test bed for testing my algorithms .

---

# Technologies Used 
* pipenv - for creating virtual environments
* open-Ai Gym - provides the test bed for evaluating Genetic Algorithms 
* numpy - for training
* pyeasyga - Genetic algorithms

*This section will be edited as the project progresses*

---

# Current Status
Current status is *Q-Table* based implemention for *taxi-v3* environment has been done

---

# File Descriptions
* Pipfile , Pipfile.lock - Files created by python virtual environments
* sampleGAusage.py - File showing a simple example of Genetic Algorithm
* TaxiAgent.py - Class based implementation of Q-Table based agent for solving a environment
* TestTaxiAgent.py , TestTaxiRandomAgent.py , TrainTaxiAgent.py - examples used for building the q table based agent 

---

# How To Run The Code ?
1)Download or pull the repo
2)Go To Parent folder and run *pipenv install* in the terminal
3)Run command *pipenv shell* in command prompt and you will land in the virtual environment 
4)Now you can run *python filename.py* to run the files

---

# TODO
Still to write the implementation of using genetic algorithms to estimate the hyperparameters

# About Me
I am software developer with decent knowledge of C++ , python and web technologies ( HTML , javascript , css ) ( mainly react )
Reinforcement Learning is a interest area for me and this is my first step in the open source world using it.
